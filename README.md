## FINAL PROJECT - MYTHOMAGIC

### Assets
- Minecraft Standard font was found on dafont.com: https://www.dafont.com/minecraft-standard.font
- Card sprites were made by me and my younger sister Christina! I used phaser.js to create a canvas filled with basic shapes that would outline the card templates, and saved that as an image. I then sent this to my sister, who created pixel art for each individual character. It was very fun discussing the art style and other artistic choices. They all turned out AMAZING and I am super grateful that she helped me out!

### Postmortem

**Take some time to consider the actual process of working on this particular project. Much learning happens in the process of looking back on things. Was it smooth or pretty rocky? Why do you think that was?**

This whole project was an absolute adventure, and I definitely think the adventure is far from over. When I was working on this for Project 3, I was initially excited because I felt like I had a really good handle on how to program things, but it was much harder than I expected. My working style and programming style is very thorough, and while it has worked well for me in the past, it caused me to end up wasting a lot of time on Project 3, and I was unhappy with what little I was able to submit. So after emailing Professor and working out a compromise for grading, I made a very daring decision: I would restart my entire project from scratch. This sounds like it would only cause me to waste more time and prevent myself from finishing what was important. But instead, it provided a complete mental and physical reset that allowed me to collect my thoughts, better organize myself, and tackle this project with a better sense of direction. And even though I still was unable to finish the project properly, I am incredibly proud of all the code that I managed to write, and I am incredibly proud that I managed to make something sleek and at least half functional despite everything holding me back. In a class about programming patterns, I think I absolutely delivered.

**How does this project compare to previous projects you've worked on. Feel free to compare it to any other projects you've worked on for any other class or in any other context (ie. passion project, game jam, prior work experience, internship, etc.)**

Working on this project felt quite similar to CSE-120 projects. The biggest differences between these projects and the other projects I've worked on for other classes is that with these ones, there is absolutely zero starter code to work off of. On one hand, this means we have to do more work, but on the other hand, it means we get to write all of our code exactly the way we want to and really get to know our project. This idea is even more prevalant with this project because this class is all about programming patterns, and paying VERY close attention to HOW you organize your code. So doing this project correctly is a very satisfying feeling for me that I haven't found in any other project.

**What was the biggest triumph or thing you're proud of on this project?**

I didn't manage to get a fully functioning game, but I am INCREDIBLY proud of my use of programming patterns---Command, State Machine, Type Object, Component, Event Queue, and so on. Just a few weeks ago I was having trouble understanding almost all of these, but after dedicating some time to properly learning them, it made programming this assignment way more fun and rewarding than anything else I've worked on. There were quite a few moments where after implementing a specific feature in my project and testing it out, I would immediately say out loud, "I'm SO good at programming!!!"

**What was the biggest annoyance, problem, failure, or area for future improvement?**

I've talked all about my work style getting in the way of progress in Project 3, as well as here. I'm very perfectionist and I always try to make things align just right. This was one of the first times where it didn't work well for me. But aside from that, trying to work on this project while also trying to manage finals for my other two classes, a bothersome living situation, ADHD, and immense burnout. I really wanted to do more on this project and really think this could have been amazing. But for now that will have to wait.

**Would you want to work on something like this again? Why or why not?**

I might need a bit of a break for now, but I would absolutely like to work on something like this again, and in fact, I plan to continue working on this project over the summer. I will also continue to look back at the programming patterns textbook because I think it will continue to make other programming projects a lot more fun.

**Feel free to include any other insights, revelation, funny bug stories, or anything else you feel is relevant to what you learned from this project.**

Card games were never very interesting to me, and I at first had some gripes with some of these projects because I didn't properly appreciate them. I am now happy to say that I have warmed up to them and appreciate them quite a bit more now. I also am surprised by how much I enjoy working in Lua. It's still a very weird language, but weird in an interesting way.
